How to grow your party:

====
Pokemon Blue you pick a starter
Buy pokeballs
capture them
Add them to your main 6 
====
Lineage II:
You create a character
Select a job
Train them
Use them individually
Requires log off to switch for another one.
====
Zelda
Single hero
====
Mario RPG: Fixed amount of heros
They are added as the story progresses
You can setup your party of 3 while in the city
You cannot select some of them based on the storyline (if kidnapped or away)
==== 
Yu Gi Oh 
Deck of 40 cards
RNG based
====
FF IX:
Same as Mario RPG
==== 
Digimon World 2
Same as Pokemon Blue
==== 
Ragnarok
As Lineage
==== 
SWGOH: 
You start with 3 default characters
Some are added via RNG
Some are added via progress
Some are added via events
Some are added via farming
Leveling and Gearing does not require the actual character to be used in order to train them (like Pokemon does)
====
Farming may feel just like Pokemon/Digimon but more time consuming ie 1-2 weeks to unlock - 3-4 months to maximize.
====
Skillsets are fixed and can improve but not too flexible. So they are unique.
